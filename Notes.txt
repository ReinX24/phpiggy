# Notes

Update httpd-vhosts.conf and hosts file in C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc.

In the vhosts file, make sure that it is configured to show the project when we
type in phpiggy.local in the browser.

In the hosts file, we add in the following so that phpiggy.local would load:
# XAMPP Virtual Hosts
# Phpiggy
127.0.0.1 phpiggy.local

To make use of autoloading in composer, use the "compose init" to create the 
composer json file and then "composer autload-dump" to generate vendor folder.

Paste the text below to virtual hosts file at this directory: 
"C:\xampp\apache\conf\extra\httpd-vhosts.conf"

# Virtual Hosts
#
# Required modules: mod_log_config

# If you want to maintain multiple domains/hostnames on your
# machine you can setup VirtualHost containers for them. Most configurations
# use only name-based virtual hosts so the server doesn't need to worry about
# IP addresses. This is indicated by the asterisks in the directives below.
#
# Please see the documentation at 
# <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/vhosts/>
# for further details before you try to setup virtual hosts.
#
# You may use the command line option '-S' to verify your virtual host
# configuration.

#
# Use name-based virtual hosting.
#
##NameVirtualHost *:80
#
# VirtualHost example:
# Almost any Apache directive may go into a VirtualHost container.
# The first VirtualHost section is used for all requests that do not
# match a ##ServerName or ##ServerAlias in any <VirtualHost> block.

# Notes

Update httpd-vhosts.conf and hosts file in C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc.

In the vhosts file, make sure that it is configured to show the project when we
type in phpiggy.local in the browser.

In the hosts file, we add in the following so that phpiggy.local would load:
# XAMPP Virtual Hosts
# Phpiggy
127.0.0.1 phpiggy.local

To make use of autoloading in composer, use the "compose init" to create the 
composer json file and then "composer autload-dump" to generate vendor folder.
